### networkMenu created by Håvard Moås  :
This was a private project that I was working on during christmas 2013. 
Its mainly designed to easily check your ip adresses like the standard gateway and my public address, aswell as the ISP.

Its also designed to check nearby Wifi networks and their channels. This was to easily check if you have to change youre Routers channel to avoid interuption.

It got extended with options like: 

*Check the OS' of devices connected to the network.

*Traceroute.

*Scan the top 10 most interesting ports on the network.

*Check internet download and upload speed.

#### Requirements
* LINUX!
* speedtest-cli - https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli. This has to be cloned inside /networkMenu/
* Nmap.
* Python
* iwlist
* nmcli
